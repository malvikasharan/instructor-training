## I. Information For and About Instructor Trainers
Details about the Instructor Trainer role including the application process, duties, meetings, and administrative instructions are now housed in the [Carpentries Handbook][handbook]. To the extent that information in those instructions is directly pertinent to teaching an Instructor Training workshop, some items may be duplicated here. All other information previously housed on this page may now be found in the handbook. [Instructions on running a Demo session][demos] are also provided in the Trainer Guide.

## II. Running an Instructor Training Event (General)

### Four weeks before the event
-  Contact your co-Trainer(s) and decide who will teach what.  
-  Create an event Etherpad (using the [Etherpad template][etherpad-template]) or Google Doc (there is now a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P_w1rgdVk4SpXvILSS-ZKz8Ujqklfujpc_zHf8D-G1A/edit?usp=sharing) for that, too) and a workshop website (using the [training template][training-template]). *Be sure to check the event Etherpad or Google Doc against the curriculum as you prepare to teach, as these may not be reliably updated with curriculum changes.*
-  Send Etherpad/Google Doc and website links to training@carpentries.org.  

### Two weeks before the event
-  Introduce yourself to your trainees.  

### One week before the event    
-  Plan logistics with co-Trainer(s)
-  Review (or set aside time closer to the event to review) the pre-assessment survey results for your workshop
-  If teaching remotely:
  -  Test videoconferencing set up with co-Trainer(s) using login credentials provided.   
  -  Decide with co-Trainer(s) whether all Trainers should be present for the full event or if you will log on during your scheduled teaching times only.  
  -  Make a copy of the [Virtual Minute Cards template][minute-cards-template] and personalize for your event.  
-  If teaching in person:
  - Confirm with your host that breakout rooms are available or make an alternate plan
  - Create a plan for printing handouts & determine who will bring sticky notes
  - Make sure you're prepared for the audiovisual setup in your room with the correct dongles/connectors etc.
  - Check on availability/timing of breaks, lunch, or any other details that matter to you

### During the event
-  Take attendance.  
-  Remind member trainees to fill out application (Open Training applicants have already done this).   
-  Remind trainees to sign up for demo, discussion (links in [checkout checklist][checkout-checklist]).  
-  Monitor the Etherpad / Google Doc for questions and responses to exercises.  
-  If teaching remotely: Turn off video during long exercises and breaks and disconnect during lunch.  

### Immediately after the event
-  Send a list of those who completed the training to checkout@carpentries.   
-  Send an email to trainees thanking them for participating and linking to [checkout checklist][checkout-checklist]. See template [here][post-template].  
-  Review survey results and prepare to discuss at upcoming [Trainers discussion meeting][trainer-pad].  
-  File any relevant issues or PRs to the [instructor training repo][training-repo].  

### Long-term after the event
-  Join a [Trainer discussion meeting][trainer-pad] to discuss how your event went.   

## III. Differences Among Training Types

### In-person trainings
- When watching videos, project them to the whole group.   
- Assign (or let participants select) physical breakout groups.  
- Use physical sticky notes to get minute card feedback at lunch breaks and end of each day.  

### Online trainings (a few small groups)
- When watching videos, have one Trainer do a screenshare with their audio on or have one person in each group play the video for the participants at their site.  
- Assign (or let participants select) physical breakout groups.  
- Use the [virtual minute card][minute-cards-template] form to get feedback at lunch breaks and end of each day.  
- Have participants do all small-group exercises with participants at same site.  

### Online trainings (completely distributed)  
- When watching videos, have all participants watch separately.  
- Assign breakout groups randomly to breakout rooms in Zoom. Be sure to remove Trainers and helpers when assigning groups.
- Use the [virtual minute card][minute-cards-template] form to get feedback at lunch breaks and end of each day.  
- Have participants screen share with their breakout room during the live coding exercises.   
- For exercise to set up a workshop website, put participants in breakout rooms and have one person screen share while the others help guide them verbally.  

## IV. Zoom Manual (Online Trainings)
Online Carpentry Instructor Training events are held on [Zoom][zoom-home]. You can set up a personal Zoom
account for yourself for free. This personal account will be able to attend the training event
(or any other online Carpentry event), but will not be able to act as host.   

About a week before your event, you will be given login credentials for a Carpentry account.
This account will be the host for the event and will have extra privileges including the
ability to mute participants and assign participants into breakout rooms. Decide ahead of time with your co-Trainer(s) who will log-in with these credentials. The host
can transfer host privileges to other participants, so you will be able to trade host status
back and forth with your co-Trainers during the event.  

All Carpentry online events are set-up such that participants can enter the room without the
host being present. If you ever get an error message saying you can’t join the room because
you’re not the host, please contact Carpentry staff immediately.   

### Host abilities:  
- “Mute” is in the lower left. To mute other participants, the host can go to “Manage Participants”, hover over a participant’s name, and click “mute”.  
- When the room host clicks “End Meeting”, a dialogue box appears with three options: “Cancel”, “Leave Meeting” and “End Meeting for All”. Be careful not to end the meeting if you are simply leaving the room temporarily while your co-Trainer teaches.  
- Only the host has the ability to create “Breakout rooms”. The button for this is on the lower left. Breakout rooms can be assigned automatically. By default, participants will be assigned to the same groups each time breakout rooms are used. You can change participants' assignments manually if desired.  
- The host can move between breakout rooms and can send messages to all rooms simultaneously.  

### General tips for online training:  
- **Support the lead**
	- It's tempting to check-out and check email/do work when your co-teacher has taken the wheel.  Try not to do this!  Ways that you can support your co-teacher when they are leading are:
	  - Monitor the chat in zoom/notes
	  - Help post exercises + provide instructions
	  - Find links or references
	- Make sure that whomever is actively teaching always has host privileges. When you take turns instructing, remember to hand-off host privileges during the change-over.
- **Exercise management**
  - After the first exercise, keep a list of all the participants in a plain text file on your computer so can you can easily paste it into the shared note-taking doc for exercises. (G.W.)
  - Screen-share a timer/countdown clock (like [this timer from timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/timer/)) so participants know how long they have to work on exercises. (L.N)
- **Zoom tips**
  - “Gallery view” in the upper right toggles the display to show more participants' videos.  
  - “Share screen” is at the bottom middle of the screen. To end “share screen”, click the red button that will appear at the top middle of the screen when you are in screen sharing mode.  
  - When you screen share, you have the option to share individual apps or your entire desktop. The default is the full desktop.
  - The Zoom chat is not stable (it is not saved across sessions or after going into breakout rooms, and people who have just joined a room can't see previously posted chat items). We highly recommend using the Etherpad or Google Doc chat instead. For those who want to save the chat, they do that using the "More" option in the chat window, which offers "Save chat". Choosing this will save the chat to a local text file on the person's computer.
  - During breaks, learners will often turn off their video and wait for your audio cue to re-activate. This makes it look like no one is back from break, but just saying 'hello' will generally get a bunch of people to come back on video quickly.
  - When several attendees are in the same room (member trainings): it is helpful to have every participant log in separately so that you can see names and faces and they can interact by waving or using the chat. However, it is important that only one microphone and speaker should be active in the room at one time or feedback and noise will be a problem. When creating breakouts, you can either leave these people in the main room or shuffle people around to create a room just for them. Either way, ask them to leave a mic on so you can listen in.
  - Attendees might like to have a separate room (without Trainers) to network in over lunch or other breaks. Be prepared to assign that room and then close it to restart the main session.

## V. Curriculum Teaching Tips
This is a place for Trainers to leave tips and observations for those newer to the curriculum. This can provide guidance on how to navigate difficult places in the curriculum until problems can be fixed, or may provide additional instructions that are conditional to an audience or are otherwise not appropriate to/ready for a change in the curriculum itself.
